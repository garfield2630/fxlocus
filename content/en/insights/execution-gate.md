Takeaway: a gate is a set of pre-trade conditions that make execution auditable.

## Framework (text)

Regime → Location → Force → Falsification → Risk caps

## Action checklist

- Keep the gate minimal and enforceable
- “No falsification sentence” = fail
- Define automatic actions when failing (pause, close platform, review)

## Falsification & pitfalls

- Pitfall: pass/fail is ignored under emotion
- Pitfall: gate becomes complex and unusable
- Falsification: if the gate can’t be completed in 30 seconds, it’s not executable
