Takeaway: after a loss streak, switch to review mode—not more trading.

## Framework (text)

Trigger → cooldown actions → recovery conditions

## Action checklist

- 2 losses: pause + review only
- 3 losses: stop for the day + publish a review
- Define allowed actions vs forbidden actions during cooldown

## Falsification & pitfalls

- Pitfall: “win it back now”
- Pitfall: recovery based on feelings
- Falsification: if violations don’t drop after cooldown, your protocol is too soft
