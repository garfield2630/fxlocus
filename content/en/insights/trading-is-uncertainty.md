One-sentence takeaway: you don’t trade the future—you trade a repeatable process under uncertainty.

## Framework (text)

Perception → Evidence → Falsification → Risk → Execution → Review

## Key concepts

- Probability is a distribution over repeats, not a single outcome.
- Edge is structure + location, not confidence.
- Uncertainty management is boundary management.

## Common mistakes

- Turning trading into a right/wrong exam
- Letting one result rewrite the whole system
- Treating stops as failure instead of falsification

## Action checklist

- Write one sentence: what structure/regime/location are you trading?
- Write one falsification sentence per trade: “If X happens, I exit.”
- Fix risk per trade for the next 20 trades
- Review: falsification execution + violations only

## Falsification & pitfalls

- Pitfall: “uncertainty” becomes an excuse for impulse
- Pitfall: strategy hopping after normal variance
- Falsification: if you can’t write falsification clearly, you have no boundary—go back to the gate
