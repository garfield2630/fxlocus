Takeaway: FOMO is solved by rules (delay + gate), not willpower.

## Framework (text)

Missed move → identity sting → chase → stop-out → revenge → drift

## Key concepts

- Opportunities are not scarce; good locations are.
- Chasing avoids waiting and uncertainty.
- FOMO is execution, not strategy.

## Action checklist

- Enforce a 3-minute delay before any chase entry
- During delay: write Force/Location/Falsification + check daily risk + run the gate
- Write 5 fail rules for typical FOMO setups

## Falsification & pitfalls

- Pitfall: treating FOMO as personality instead of system design
- Pitfall: “catch every move” as the goal
- Falsification: if you can’t delay, your gate isn’t hard enough—add hard limits
